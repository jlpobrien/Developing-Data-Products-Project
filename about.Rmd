## Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

#### This project develops a tool to predict son's height given their father's height.


#### It uses data collected by Karl Pearson around 1903, which was infuenced by Francis Galton's past famous work.


#### Data includes 1078 measurements.


#### The method is a linear regression. The 45 degree line shows that the heights of fathers and sons were not equal.


#### The dataset ```father.son``` can be found in the ```UsingR``` package.
